## Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of C++ in embedded systems, specifically using STM32 microcontrollers. The goal is to provide a learning resource for developers transitioning from general C++ programming to embedded development. The project includes core components, hardware drivers, and practical examples, all aimed at showcasing the capabilities of STM32 microcontrollers and the efficiency of C++ in embedded programming.

### Memory Mapped I/O

In this project, I aim to implement Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO) for hardware interaction. MMIO maps peripheral control registers to specific memory addresses, allowing direct read/write operations on hardware registers through standard memory access instructions.

#### Benefits of Memory Mapped I/O:

1. **Efficiency**: Directly accessing hardware registers via memory addresses eliminates the overhead associated with traditional I/O instructions, resulting in faster and more efficient hardware interactions.
2. **Simplicity**: Using pointers to access memory-mapped registers simplifies code, making it easier to read, write, and maintain.
3. **Flexibility**: MMIO allows for fine-grained control over hardware, enabling precise manipulation of peripheral settings and states.
4. **Portability**: Code using MMIO can be easily adapted to different microcontrollers with similar memory-mapped architectures by adjusting base addresses.

## Repository Structure

- **Core/**: Core components and configurations.
- **Drivers/**: Hardware drivers and related files.

## Features

- **GPIO Class**: Comprehensive implementation for STM32 microcontrollers.
- **Modern C++**: Utilizes C++11/14/17 features.
- **HAL Integration**: Seamless hardware control via STM32 HAL.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
