## Overview üåê

This repository demonstrates the application of C++ in embedded systems, specifically using STM32 microcontrollers. The goal is to provide a learning resource for developers transitioning from general C++ programming to embedded development. The project includes core components, hardware drivers, and practical examples, all aimed at showcasing the capabilities of STM32 microcontrollers and the efficiency of C++ in embedded programming.

## Recent changes (Sept 17, 2025)

This project received a focused refactor of the GPIO/EXTI subsystem and an example application demonstrating interrupt-driven button handling.

- Implemented a static registry for EXTI-capable GPIO objects so external interrupts dispatch to the correct C++ object and callback.
- Moved the EXTI IRQ handlers into the CubeMX-friendly `Core/Src/stm32l4xx_it.c` (C ISRs) which forward to a C-wrapper that calls `GPIO::GPIOEXTI::handleInterrupt(pin)`.
- Removed the separate `gpio_isr_example.cpp` file and added an App example (`App/Src/App.cpp`) that uses LED on PB11 and buttons on PC0..PC3.
- Refactored `GPIOEXTI::configureEXTI()` to simplify EXTI source selection and SYSCFG mapping.
- Switched to RAII-style initialization: constructors perform hardware configuration and `GPIOEXTI` objects register/unregister themselves in the static registry; a destructor cleans up on deletion.
- Improved const-correctness and API cleanup (removed virtual `init()` from the base class; updated headers).

If you use the GPIO/EXTI features, ensure the LL driver headers are available and your CubeMX configuration enables the EXTI/SYSCFG peripheral clocks.

## Example: what was added in `App/Src/App.cpp`

- LED on PB11 (push-pull output).
- Buttons on PC0..PC3 configured with internal pull-ups and falling-edge triggers.
- Button behaviors:
    - PC0: toggle LED
    - PC1: LED ON
    - PC2: LED OFF
    - PC3: cycle LED patterns (OFF ‚Üí ON ‚Üí slow blink ‚Üí fast blink)

The application registers lightweight callbacks for each button and defers heavier work to the main loop.

## ISR wiring and notes

- The C IRQ handlers (in `Core/Src/stm32l4xx_it.c`) now check EXTI pending flags and call a small C bridge function `GPIO_EXTI_HandleInterrupt(pin)` which forwards into C++.
- For grouped IRQs (EXTI5..9 and EXTI10..15) the ISR scans all pending lines and calls the bridge for each active pin.
- Callback functions execute in interrupt context ‚Äî keep them short and non-blocking. Use flags/atomic variables or an RTOS queue to pass work to the main task.

## Quick usage snippet

```cpp
// Create LED on PB11 and buttons on PC0..PC3
auto led = new GPIO::GPIOOutput(GPIOB, 11, GPIO::PinOutputType::PUSH_PULL);
auto b0 = new GPIO::GPIOEXTI(GPIOC, 0, GPIO::EXTITrigger::FALLING, GPIO::PinPull::PULL_UP);
// set callbacks and enable
b0->setCallback([](){ /* quick action */ });
b0->enableInterrupt();
```

## Build & run notes

- Open in STM32CubeIDE and build as usual.
- Ensure `stm32l4xx_ll_*` headers are available and CubeMX config enables the required peripherals (GPIO, SYSCFG, NVIC lines for EXTI).

## Recommendations

- Verify NVIC group handling on your STM32 part: EXTI lines share IRQs ‚Äî disabling a shared NVIC line affects all pins on the same group.
- Use the App example as a starting point and adapt pin numbers / ports to your board.
