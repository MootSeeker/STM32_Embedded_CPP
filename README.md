# STM32 Embedded C++ Project

Welcome to the STM32 Embedded C++ project repository! This project showcases how to use C++ for embedded programming on STM32 microcontrollers. It is designed as a learning resource for those who are transitioning from general C++ programming to embedded systems development.

## Repository Structure

- **Core/**: Core components and configurations.
- **Drivers/**: Hardware drivers and related files.

## Features

- **GPIO Class**: Comprehensive implementation for STM32 microcontrollers.
- **Modern C++**: Utilizes C++11/14/17 features.
- **HAL Integration**: Seamless hardware control via STM32 HAL.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- STM32CubeIDE or a compatible IDE.
- Basic C++ and embedded systems knowledge.
- STM32 development board (e.g., STM32F4 Discovery, STM32 Nucleo).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MootSeeker/STM32_Embedded_CPP.git
    cd STM32_Embedded_CPP
    ```
2. Open in STM32CubeIDE.
3. Build and upload to your STM32 board.

## ToDo

- [ ] Complete GPIO class
- [ ] Implement class for Timer
- [ ] Implement class for ADC
- [ ] Implement class for DAC
- [ ] Implement class for CRC
- [ ] Implement class for SPI
- [ ] Implement class for I2C
- [ ] Implement class for CAN
- [ ] Implement class for QSPI
- [ ] Implement class for USART
- [ ] Create examples for all interfaces
- [ ] Transition to Bare Metal, removing HAL dependencies
